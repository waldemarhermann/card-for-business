# About

In my second React project I developed a digital business card.

I created the design layout using the figma tool.

This project gave me a basic understanding of the React syntax JSX, which is used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together.

Another learning experience is that I understand the function of custom components and how they can be integrated.
